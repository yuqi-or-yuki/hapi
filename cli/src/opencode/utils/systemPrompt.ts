    Use the title tool sparingly. For a new chat, call the tool "hapi_change_title" once after the user's initial request is clear, and set a concise task title. Do not rename the chat for routine progress, substeps, implementation details, or a slightly better wording. Rename only when the user's primary objective changes substantially and the existing title would be misleading.
    When you create or find a local image file that the user should see, call the tool "hapi_display_image" with the image path so HAPI can show it inline.

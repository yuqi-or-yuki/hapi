/**
 * Final audit for test-owned processes.
 *
 * The runner integration suite spawns real detached process trees. Even with
 * the per-test registry (see `processRegistry.ts`), an orphan whose runner was
 * already killed, or a child that escaped a crashing test, can survive the
 * suite. This module is the last-resort backstop: it scans the live process
 * table for the run's unique marker (`HAPI_TEST_MARKER=<tmpHome>`, injected by
 * `integrationEnv.ts` into every test child) and force-reaps whatever remains.
 *
 * The marker lives in the process environment, which survives reparenting to
 * PID 1, so orphaned grandchildren are still recognized. Production processes
 * never carry the marker and are never touched.

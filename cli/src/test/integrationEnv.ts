/**
 * Test-child environment builder for the runner integration suite.
 *
 * Every real CLI child the suite spawns must run with this environment so
 * that:
 *
 * 1. Identity variables of the outer HAPI/pi session (PI_SESSION_ID,
 *    HAPI_SESSION_ID, PM2 metadata, ...) never leak into test children.
 *    These are blanked rather than dropped because `spawnHappyCLI` merges
 *    `{ ...process.env, ...options.env }` — a blank value still wins over the
 *    inherited one, while a missing key would let the parent value through.
 * 2. Every child carries a unique per-run marker (`HAPI_TEST_MARKER=<tmpHome>`)
 *    that the final audit (see `auditTestProcesses.ts`) can use to recognize
 *    test-owned processes even after they have been orphaned/reparented to
 *    PID 1.
 *
 * The worker env already points at the isolated temporary hub (see
 * `setup.ts`), so the hub credentials stay intact while session identity and
 * well-known secrets are neutralized.

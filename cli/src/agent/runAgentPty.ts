 * PTY. All flavor-specific behavior is supplied via options:
 *  - `command` / `args` / `cwd` / `envVars` / `extraEnv` — how to spawn
 *  - `promptMarkers` — strings that indicate the agent's input prompt has
 *    rendered. When provided, input-ready is gated on seeing one of them.
 *    When omitted, falls back to an output-idle heuristic.

 * The driver handles the parts every PTY agent shares: spawn lifecycle,
 * waiting until the agent is ready before sending the first message, echo-
 * confirmed submit with retry (so the first keystrokes aren't dropped while the
 * agent wires up stdin), and the message loop.
